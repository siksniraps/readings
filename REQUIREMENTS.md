#KPI Berry Technical Task 1
##Instructions
1) Create a Docker container that runs a HTTP API on TCP port 8080.
2) Design the API so it exposes the following endpoints:
    - ~~listing all readings~~
    - ~~retrieving an existing reading~~
    - ~~adding a new reading~~
    - ~~modifying existing reading~~
    - ~~deleting existing reading~~
    - retrieve statistics of readings in a specific time window (see below for statistics)
            
        ~~~
        Reading object:
          id: int,
          value: float,
          timestamp: datetime
        ~~~
            
    - At least the following statistics need to be calculated (can do more):
    - reading count
    - mean
    - variance
    - select one of statistical tests that test data for Gaussian distribution, and check if given data is drawn from Normal distribution (choose reasonable p-value threshold yourself)
    - if data comes from Normal distribution, calculate confidence interval (choose confidence threshold yourself)
    - select one of statistical tests that test data for stationarity, and check if given time series is stationary (choose p-value threshold yourself)

3) Optional: include a pytest test (no need for extensive coverage - just a sample)
### Notes
- Use Python, Flask for the API service.
- Persistent store is not required, use runtime data structures (if you decide to use persistent store such as SQLite and ORM such SQLAlchemy - this would be a bonus).
- If you feel some detail is missing, feel free to make your own decisions (documenting them in README). 
### Deliverable
An archive containing:
- concise README.TXT containing
  - instructions how to start the service
  - a list of supported endpoints with request parameters and expected responses
  - anything else you deem necessary
- Dockerfile
- Python file(-s) 
- Anything else required to launch the service (scripts, configuration files)
### Assessment
* Clear instructions in README.TXT
* API design adherence to REST API best practices
* Request, calculation errors are handled gracefully
* Code readability
* Right choice of statistical methods
* Any additional improvement, initiative is very welcome!
